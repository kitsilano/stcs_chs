### Executive Summary

Statistics Canada just published the results of the 2018 Canadian
Household Survey. von Bergmann and Lauster used the publicly-available
data to analyze mobility in Canada, with an emphasis on forced moves
and tenure precarity.


A new research project aims at expanding the analysis \cite{blog}
to account for low-income women as well as different neighborhoods within
Vancouver. Once the 2021 CHS data become available, the project also aims
to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on low-income women
tenure precarity.


### Project objectives

The project poses three statistical questions:

1. whether the publicly-available data from the 2018 CHS is appropriate
  for statistical inference;
2. whether the statistical analyses in \cite{blog} can also be applied
  to study the impact of gender and income in forced moves in Vancouver;
3. whether the analyses of \cite{blog}, which are done at the city
  level, can be expanded to include more geographic granularity within Vancouver.


### Directory roadmap

Each directory includes its own README file. In general:
* `data` is for saving data files.
* `doc` includes the written portions of the project.
* `misc` contains miscelaneous files.
* `src` includes the code developed for the project.
